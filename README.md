# Practical Training Overview

Welcome to the practical training module for High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Linux basics. This training is divided into several steps to guide you through setting up the necessary environment and practicing key concepts related to HPC and Linux commands.

Please follow the sequence of the provided **README.md** files in the order listed below to ensure proper setup and understanding.

---

## 1. Pre-installation Setup

Before you begin, it is crucial to prepare your computer with the necessary tools and software. Refer to the **Pre-install-README.md** for detailed instructions on installing all required programs and setting up your environment.

- **Pre-install-README.md** covers:
  - Installation of **VS Code** (Visual Studio Code)
  - Installing **Git** and cloning the repository
  - Setting up **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** or any Linux environment (for Windows users)
  - Installing necessary extensions for VS Code

Please make sure your environment is correctly configured before moving to the next module.

## 2. Module 1: HPC Login

Once your setup is complete, move on to **Module 1**. This module focuses on logging into an HPC environment using **SSH** (Secure Shell) from your local machine. This is the foundation for accessing remote HPC resources.

- **Module1_HPC-login** covers:
  - Using **SSH** to log into an HPC server
  - Understanding the basic structure of HPC systems
  - Basic SSH commands for secure remote connections

Ensure you can successfully log in to the simulated or actual HPC environment before proceeding to the next module.

## 3. Module 2: Basic Linux and Basic HPC Commands

In **Module 2**, you will begin learning essential **Linux commands** for file management, navigation, and system administration in a server environment. You will also practice basic **HPC commands** for submitting jobs and checking job statuses.

- **Module2_Basic-Linux-HPC-Commands** covers:
  - Basic Linux commands such as `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `pwd`, and `rm`
  - Creating and editing files in Linux
  - Simulating job scheduling in an HPC environment with commands like `sbatch` and `squeue`
  
Complete the exercises in this module to build a strong foundation in both **Linux** and **HPC** operations.

## How to Proceed

Follow the order of the **README.md** files step by step:
1. **Pre-install-README.md**: Set up your environment.
2. **Module1_HPC-login**: Learn how to access HPC environments.
3. **Module2_Basic-Linux-HPC-Commands**: Practice Linux and HPC job commands.

Each module builds upon the previous one, so please complete them in sequence for the best learning experience.
